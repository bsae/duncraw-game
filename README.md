Roguelite Deck Builder (with co-op and pvp eventually*)

## Initial Game Loop Idea: 
Look at enemy cards this round. Draw cards from your deck and pick cards to empower your character for the level.
After successfully completing the level, you have the option to 
  1) chose a card to add to your deck, **and/or**
  2) remove a card from your deck.
Every run rewards a currency that can be used to carry permanent upgrades to your character. For example, player can increase the number of cards they start a level with permanently.
Each level increases in difficulty, with every few levels having a 'special encounter'

###### Some inspirations:
Diablo series (action role-playing), Hades (roguelite), Slay the Spire (deckbuilding), Legends of Runeterra (deckbuilding)
