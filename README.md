Role-playing Roguelite Deck Builder (multiplayer could include something like wow arena pvp)

## Initial Game Loop Idea: 
See a run-long major debuff. Then pick your 3 character party for the run. Previously permanently unlocked skill points can be reassigned depending on the run before it begins.
Procedurally generated levels. Look at enemy cards for each level. Draw cards from your deck and pick cards to empower your characters for the level.
After successfully completing the level, you have the option to 

  1) chose a card to add to your deck, **and/or**
  2) remove a card from your deck.

Each level increases in difficulty, with every few levels having a special encounter.
If a character dies during the run, they will stay incapacitated for the rest of the run (unless revived during the run).
Every run rewards a currency that can be used to carry permanent upgrades to your characters. For example, player can increase the number of cards they start a level with permanently.

## Character Ideas:
1) Daggers/shortswords: balance of offensive and defensive melee combat, supportive abilities
2) Sword and Shield: primarily defensive melee combat, defensive abilities
3) Greatmace: primarily offensive melee combat, offensive abilities
4) Bow: balance of offensive and defensive ranged combat, supportive abilities
5) Holy caster: primarily defensive ranged combat, defensive abilities
6) Shadow caster: primarily offensive ranged combat, offensive abilities

###### Some inspirations:
Star Wars KOTOR (party combat), DnD (combat roles), Hades (roguelite), Slay the Spire (deckbuilding)
